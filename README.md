Cryptograph (Fudan Information Security 2020 PJ)

This is an information security course project to complement a DES cryptograph.
The main DES algorithm is realized in `/code/des.cpp`, compling to `/program/desCore.exe`.
To make it easier to use, a GUI is also added above this core, by using windform and C#.
It is very convinient to use by one click on `/program/DES.exe`.
You can also check the manual at the root directory. (Chinese Vers.)
